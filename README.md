# lsd-snake
A snake game with a hacky filter.

# About
This code was poorly wrote by me, in March 2018 to have fun with SDL2.
I really like preserving things, so I kept even weird and perhaps non-functional 
code there in comments.

It's a really cool filter in my opinion though.

# Bulding
SDL2 is required. Make sure the Makefile is pointing to the correct directory
of your SDL2 library paths.
